### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I learned a new way to center images inside button elements. Its something I've had an issue before taking on this challenge. I had used background-image and background position properties previously to solve the issue but when it came to changing the state when clicked i had another issue which i was able to solve using inline svg in the button element and setting the button to display flex.
